So if you don't love it, if you're not having fun doing it, you don't really love it, you're gonna give up. And that's what happens to most people, actually. If you really look at the ones that ended up being successful, unquote, in the eyes of society, and the ones that didn't, oftentimes it's the ones that are successful loved what they did so they could persevere when it got really tough. And the ones that didn't love it quit, because they're sane, right? Who would wanna put up with this stuff if you don't love it? So it's a lot of hard work, and it's a lot of worrying constantly. And if you don't love it, you're gonna fail."

It was first observed in 1953 under the auspices of the International Union for Child Welfare, a federation of national and international organizations which are concerned with safeguarding the rights of the child. World Children's Day is a day for remembering our responsibility to children everywhere. This is a duty which works in our own interest. For only a healthy and happy generation will be able to shape the world of tomorrow in such a way that each and every person shall have a place in the sun. World Children's Day is a day for remembering our responsibility to children. It can also be a day for doing something about that responsibility through active support of our national and international child service agencies."
